   <h1>There Was a Country</h1> <!--title of my favourite book -->
     <p>There was a country was a personal history of Biafra by the writer <b>Chinua Achebe</b>. This book talks about so many events that transpired before the Nigerian civil war. Like what and what led to the war? how each region contributed to the civil war, and how it affected each region most especcially the writers tribe. Everything written in this book was based on the writers account. He talked about the biafran people and how they were subjected to die after the war.</p>

    <p>This book was in stages, it started with the kind of world in which the writer was born, the type of education he got, the friends he made, the woman he fell in love with and married, the jobs that came along, the story of how <i>Things Fall Apart</i> came to be written, and almost not published. The book has so many hidden details about what transpired between Gowon and Ojukwu. What made the millions of children die during and after the war, because of what the nigerians soldiers were doing by seizing abd blocking the food supply. The work got the author reviews from great persons; one of whom is the former president of <strong>South Africa,</strong><em>Nelson Mandela</em> who said <q>The writer in whose company the prison walls fell down.</q><cite>wikipedia</cite>

  <p>There are so many critics about this book. Critics who thinks the book wa sone sided and couldnt be used to judge about the war. They believed that it took the writer too long a time to talk about the Nigerian civil war. I dont dislike any aspect of this book. I enjoyed every chapter I read inside this book. I got to know so many things about my history that have been scrapped out from our schools curriculum.</p>
